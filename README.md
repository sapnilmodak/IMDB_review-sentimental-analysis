This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews (positive or negative) using a **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. The model processes the sequential nature of text data to predict the sentiment of a given review.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Sentiment analysis using Simple RNN.
- Preprocessing of IMDB movie review data.
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualizations of training performance (loss and accuracy).
- Easy-to-follow code for learning and replication.
