# IMDB Review Sentiment Analysis ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ­

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews (positive or negative) using a **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. The model processes the sequential nature of text data to predict the sentiment of a given review.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Sentiment analysis using Simple RNN.
- Preprocessing of IMDB movie review data.
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualizations of training performance (loss and accuracy).
- Easy-to-follow code for learning and replication.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Accuracy**: ~85% on the test set.
- **Loss**: Tracked over 10 epochs.

### Model Training Performance

| Metric        | Value      |
|---------------|------------|
| Train Accuracy| 86%        |
| Test Accuracy | 84%        |
| Epochs        | 10         |

## ðŸš§ Future Improvements

- Use more advanced architectures like LSTM, GRU, or Transformers.
- Explore data augmentation for better performance.
- Add a web-based interface for live predictions.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
